- üó£Ô∏è Explaining thought process out loud
- ‚ö° Optimizing space/time complexity

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Daily Practice Strategy**

### **Problem Selection Method:**

1. **Warm-up:** Start with 1 Easy problem you've solved before (5-10 min)
2. **Main Challenge:** Tackle 1-2 new problems at target difficulty (45-90 min)
3. **Review:** Re-solve 1 previous problem with focus on optimization (15-30 min)

### **Implementation Approach:**

1. **Understand:** Read problem 2-3 times, identify patterns
2. **Plan:** Write pseudocode/approach before coding
3. **Code:** Implement with comprehensive test cases
4. **Optimize:** Review time/space complexity, refactor if needed
5. **Reflect:** Document key insights and patterns learned
